### Bonjour mes amis
This is ***Shrey Gupta***. I am a graduate student at the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I graduated from IIIT Hyderabad with BTech (Honors) in Computer Science in Engineering. I am interested in contributing to Open-Source Development and very intrigued by machine and deep learning, thus trying to get my hands dirty. I am fond of working with people as it helps me grow and explore new things; therefore, I look forward to working with the community.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ML and DL Projects while nurturing them further
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open-Source ML/DL/Algorithms Projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning, Data Structures, Algos, and Python (+ Movies and TV Shows:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I watch a lot of movies and play Basketball
